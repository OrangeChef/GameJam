# GameJam

Text script:
"BOING!" is a short Foddian-style game developed by OrangeChef for the Ludwig Jam in just under 3 days.
In it, your task is to bounce up to the summit of an ice mountain with a spring, facing opposite of the mouse at all times.
Without friction, you'll slip and slide easily. Always make sure to have save strategy in-case something goes wrong.
Oh, and watch out for water, you'll freeze to death and restart!
Well, good luck!
