# GameJam

Text script:
"Boing!" is a short Foddian-style game developed by OrangeChef for the Ludwig Jam in just under 3 days.
In it your task is to bounce up to the summit of an ice mountain with a spring which faces opposite of the mouse at all times.
Without friction you'll slip and slide easily, so always be sure to have a backup strategy in-case something goes wrong.
Oh and watch out for water; you'll freeze to death and restart!
Well, good luck!
